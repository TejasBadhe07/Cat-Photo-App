# Cat-Photo-App
The most common HTML tags for building your own cat photo app.

HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.
A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag.
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat.
A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. if we keep target="_blank" then the link will open in new tab.
Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
The <ul> tag in HTML is used to define the unordered list item in an HTML document. It contains the list items <li> element. The <ul> tag requires an opening and closing tag.
Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list.
