# Accessibility by Building Quiz Webpage

Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to use â€“ even people with disabilities.

In this part, I'll be building a quiz webpage. Accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.

Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.

A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.

The child combinator selector > is used between selectors to target only elements that match the second selector and are a direct child of the first selector.

This can be helpful when you have deeply nested elements and want to control the scope of your styling.

Use the > selector to target the unordered list elements within the nav elements, and use Flexbox to evenly space the children.

As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers. You can semantically separate the content within the form using section elements.

To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.

Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.

It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.

This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input.

Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.

Arguably, D.O.B. is not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is to add text only a screen reader can read.


The .sr-only text is still visible. There is a common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read.

This pattern is to set the following CSS properties:

position: absolute;
width: 1px;
height: 1px;
padding: 0;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
white-space: nowrap;
border: 0;

To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow both to be selected at the same time.

Add an id to all of your radio inputs so you can link your labels to them.
