# Basic CSS by building Cafe Menu
## CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.

CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.
The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.
The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements 
To apply the class's styling to the div element, remove the id attribute and add a class attribute to the div element's opening tag. 
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.
You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.

You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
You can change the font-family of text, to make it look different from the default font of your browser. Each browser has some common fonts available to it.

element {
 property: value;
}

You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:

selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}

Comments in CSS look like this:

/* comment here */

A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:

.class-name {
  styles
}

since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
if you want to center the #menu horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element.
